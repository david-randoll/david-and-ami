                I never thought I would ever find a girlfriend, much less someone as beautiful as you. Every night, on
                our calls, I realize how lucky I am to have you in my life. I am extremely grateful to God for sending
                you into my life. He has blessed me with the most amazing person in the world and I canâ€™t thank him
                enough. I love you so much, and I canâ€™t imagine my life without you.

                The love and care you have shown me over the past year have been nothing short of amazing. We fought
                over when I can eat peanut butter. We found over the not applying for the citizenship. We found over you
                not watching my videos to you now watching all my reals ðŸ˜š. We had our ups and downs, but we always came
                out stronger. I hope we can continue to grow together, make more memories and not let any little thing
                come between us. I love you so much, and I canâ€™t wait to fight more with you. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜œ

                I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s been a year already. Youâ€™ve made every moment special, and Iâ€™m so grateful to have
                you by my side. Hereâ€™s to many more years of love, joy, and laughter. Happy anniversary, my love! I love
                you to the sun and back! I love you more than anyone in the world has ever loved anyone. I love you, my
