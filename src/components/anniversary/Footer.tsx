            <p className="max-w-xl mx-auto text-lg">
                I never thought I would ever find a girlfriend, much less someone as beautiful as you. Every night, as
                we share our calls, I realize how lucky I am to have you in my life. Those moments, filled with laughter
                and love, make the distance feel so much smaller. Your voice is like a melody that brightens my days and
                soothes my nights, and I cherish each conversation we share.
            </p>
            <p className="max-w-xl mx-auto text-lg my-6">
                It’s not just the big moments that I treasure; it's the little quirks that make our relationship so
                special. I can’t help but smile every time you playfully fight me over my love for peanut butter. Those
                silly disagreements bring a warmth to my heart and remind me of the joy in our everyday life together.
                Your playful spirit is infectious, and it lights up my world in ways I never knew were possible.
            </p>
            <p className="max-w-xl mx-auto text-lg">
                I can’t believe it’s been a year already. You’ve made every moment special, and I’m so grateful to have
                you by my side. Here’s to many more years of love, joy, and adventures. I love you, my bubu phudu!
